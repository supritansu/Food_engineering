We are trying to convert electrical nose signals and electrical tongue signals through fourier transform techniques for better analysis and classification of 400 tea samples. We have been able to show that when signals of nose and tongue combined together , the stability and accuracy of the
clssification process increases than when used separately. we have also shown the areas through saliency maps that on which freq/amplitudes of the short term fourier transform our model is focussing on for analysis and classification which 
can be helpful in the future.
We will also use this signal data as direct time series and try to see which method is working best.
